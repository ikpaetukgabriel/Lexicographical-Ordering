# Lexicographical-Ordering
Compares multiple strings in a different way than numerals: 
the more digits a positive integer has, the greater it is, 
but that's not true for strings. Their order is similar to 
the alphabetic one for the same case words.  When comparing 
lowercase and uppercase letters, the alphabetic order has a 
distinct feature. For example, all Latin-script uppercase letters 
are less than any lowercase letter in ASCII encoding, therefore Z < a. 
It also compares any symbols with letters because they all 
map to integer values.
